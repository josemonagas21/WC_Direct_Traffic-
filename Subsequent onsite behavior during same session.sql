-- WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND USER BEHAVIOR AFTER THEY LAND ON THE WC HP VIA DIRECT OR ORGANIC SEARCH
-- STEPS TAKEN:
-- 1) OBTAIN THE SESSION INDEX FOR THESE GROUP OF USERS AND 
-- 2) LOOK AT THE SUBSEQUENT PAGEVIEWS AND CLICKS THEY HAVE DURING THAT SAME SESSION INDEX AND FILTER BY THOSE CASES WHERE THEIR "agent_day_session_pageview_index" > 1 TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE SUBSEQUENT PAGEVIEWS DURING THAT SESSION. 
-- THE APPROACH IS AS FOLLOW:
-- RUN THE FIRST SCRIP AND CREATE A TEMPORARY TABLE WITH THE SESSION DATA 
-- NEXT RUN THE SECOND SCRIP AND ADD THAT CREATED TABLE IN THE "SUBSET" CTE 
-- CAVEAT: PAY ATTENTION TO THE FILTERS IN THE WHERE CLAUSE. DEVICE AND SESSION_CHANNEL_2
